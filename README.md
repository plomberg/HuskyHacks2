HuskyHacks2

An internet-connected weather station that not only tells you the weather, but shows it to you.
Designed for the Husky Hacks 2.0 Hackathon, this device creates a miniature world, where the weather inside reflects the weather outside. A water pump creates artificial rain, addressable smart LEDs show sunny or overcast weather, and clouds light up to mimic lightning. It used the weather underground API to display either sunny, rainy, or overcast conditions.

Dependencies:
pywu (v1.1 used here) for polling wunderground API
pyserial (v3.1.1 used here) for serial communication to the Arduino
